Example: Fabricated Experiment
------------------------------

A physical experimental setup was used to demonstrate the integration of an automated testing apparatus with the software pipeline.
The setup comprises of a brushless DC motor, with an indicator wheel connected to an arduino for remote control.
Data collection was implemented using computer vision and a USB camera, allowing for the location of the indicator wheel to be measured.
Design space parameters comprised of the amount of time of the motor being on, the amount of power delivered to the motor, the amount of power used to stop the motor, and the amount of time required for stopping the motor.
For performance, both power usage and error in the intended rotation were measured and optimized.
