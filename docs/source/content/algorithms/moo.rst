Multi-Objective Optimization
----------------------------

AutoOED supports several classical multi-objective optimization algorithms including NSGA-II and MOEA/D,
which are not as sample-efficient as multi-objective Bayesian optimization algorithms but run relatively faster. 
These algorithms also serve as an important module in multi-objective Bayesian optimization pipeline.
